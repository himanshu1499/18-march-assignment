    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that introduces an L1 penalty term into the regression equation. This penalty term forces some of the model's coefficients to be zero, effectively performing feature selection during the training process.\n",

    "Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that introduces an L2 penalty term into the regression equation. This penalty term penalizes large coefficients and can lead to more stable and robust models that generalize better to new data.\n",

    "Decision Trees: Decision trees can be used as both a feature selection method and a machine learning model. Decision trees can be trained to identify the most important features for a given problem, and these features can then be used to train a machine learning model.\n",

    " Some of the main drawbacks of the Filter method are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Ignoring feature interactions: The Filter method evaluates each feature independently of the others, and therefore ignores potential interactions between features. As a result, it may select features that are not relevant or useful when combined with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Insensitivity to model performance: The Filter method selects features based on their statistical properties, such as correlation with the target variable, and may not take into account their impact on the performance of the machine learning model. As a result, it may select features that are not useful for the specific machine learning problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Limited to linear relationships: The Filter method is based on statistical measures that assume a linear relationship between features and the target variable. It may not work well for non-linear relationships, such as those found in complex machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Dependence on the choice of statistical measure: The Filter method requires the selection of a statistical measure, such as correlation or mutual information, to evaluate the relevance of features. The choice of measure can significantly impact the set of selected features and may not be optimal for all machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Overall, the Filter method can be a good starting point for feature selection, as it is simple and computationally efficient.\n",
